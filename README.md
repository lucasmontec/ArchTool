##Architectural Visualization Tool for 'C#'

##About

 Arch tool is a simple relationship viewer for C#. This
tool parses a C# project or file bundle and displays
class interactions. A class interaction is a declara-
tion of another class inside it self, or a call,
or a member, or a method parameter.

 Currently Arch Tool doesn't differentiate between
those. It just displays a graph connecting each class
that calls another.

 Currently only supports C# but adding other languages
should be easy. I plan to add at least java, python and
maybe lua.

To load a project, just drag its folder(directory)
to the Arch Tool empty panel bellow the title. Drop
the folder(directory) there and wait for the graph
to build.
